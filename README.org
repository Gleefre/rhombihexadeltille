  This game is published under Apache 2.0 Licence.

* Installation
** Requirements
   - Libraries
     To run this game from source you need to have [[https://github.com/vydd/sketch][sketch]] and [[https://github.com/lispgames/cl-sdl2-mixer][cl-sdl2-mixer]] installed.
     To ensure that game will be working, please install sketch from github repository.
     (You'll need to clone it to local-projects folder of your quicklisp installation.
     You'll need to clone [[https://github.com/lispgames/cl-sdl2][cl-sdl2]] and [[https://github.com/lispgames/sdl2kit][sdl2.kit]] as well.)
   - Foreign dependencies
     - SDL2
       =sketch= relies on =SDL2= library which is a C library.
       You can find it's release at [[https://www.libsdl.org][libsdl webpage]].
       This game also relies on =SDL2 Image= & =SDL2 TTF= & =SDL2 Mixer=,
       all of those are part of SDL2 project.
     - libffi & OpenGL
       See [[https://github.com/vydd/sketch#foreign-dependencies][sketch's README]]
** Running
   To run this game you need to =quickload= its system:
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
   (ql:quickload :rhombihexadeltille)
   #+END_SRC
   Then you need to call the main function:
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
   (rht:start)
   #+END_SRC
   Note that you should NOT run 2 instances of the game, this will probably break it.
   
   =#'rht:start= accepts keyword parameters: =:width= of the screen, =:height= of the screen and =:fullscreen= if you want to run game in fullscreen mode.
   Note that fullscreen mode does NOT work nicely.
** Building from source
   To build an executable you need to run =make= (or =make build=) in source folder.
   That will create a folder =rhombihexadeltille-game= with an executable =rhombihexadeltille-game= inside it.
   It also will create a =.zip= file.
   To remove all files produced by =make= run =make clean=.
